In the summer of 2023, at Durham University, I conducted a comprehensive statistical investigation into the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in physics education, from GCSE to university levels. Supervised by Dr. Will Yeadon, this project explored the capabilities of non-specialist LLMs in understanding and solving physics problems.

The work involved using Python and regex to transcribe and analyze a large corpus of PDF data, and utilizing the GPT-API for interacting with the models. The findings from this research contributed to a Laidlaw Scholarship project aimed at training specialist GPTs for educational purposes, highlighting the potential of AI to revolutionize physics pedagogy.
