During the summer of 2025, I undertook a research project at the University of Cambridge's Institute of Astronomy and Kavli Institute of Cosmology, under the supervision of Dr. James Alvey.

The core of the project was to develop a robust Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) pipeline. This pipeline is designed to analyze data from the LIGO/VIRGO gravitational wave observatories and identify potential mismodeling in the signals. By leveraging machine learning techniques and advanced statistical inference, this work aims to enhance the accuracy of gravitational wave detection and analysis, contributing to our understanding of the universe's most energetic events.
