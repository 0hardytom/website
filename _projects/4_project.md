As part of my third-year advanced laboratory (AstroLab) at Durham University, I conducted an in-depth study of the W-Uma-type contact binary star system, GW-Cephei. This project, running from October 2024 to January 2025, involved using the university's telescopes to gather photometric data.

The primary goal was to model the physical characteristics and long-term variability of the binary system. My analysis, which included data reduction, time-domain photometry, and light curve analysis using techniques like simulated annealing and genetic evolution algorithms, led to the discovery of a possible new third body in the GW-Cephei system. This finding opens up new avenues for understanding the dynamics of contact binary systems.
