As a research intern at the University of Oxford in the summer of 2024, I engineered PHiSEP (Pipeline for HI Source Extraction and ProFound-evaluation). This project, supervised by Dr. Catherine Hale, Dr. Anastasia Ponomareva, and Prof. Matt Jarvis, focused on developing a pipeline for neutral hydrogen (HI) source extraction from radio astronomy data cubes.

Using Aaron Robotham's ProFound algorithm, PHiSEP was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of segmentation extractors on HI-datacubes. The project culminated in the development of an MPI-enabled High-Performance Computing (HPC) pipeline. This powerful tool is now used for analyzing data from the MIGHTEE-HI/COSMOS survey and for simulated Square Kilometre Array (SKA) data, pushing the boundaries of automated source detection in large-scale radio surveys.
