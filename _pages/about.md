I am a third-year MPhys Physics student at Durham University, predicted to achieve a High 1st Class Honours. My primary research interests lie in computational astrophysics, data analysis, and the application of machine learning to astrophysical datasets.

I am passionate about leveraging advanced computational techniques to solve complex problems in physics. My experience includes developing a Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) pipeline for gravitational wave data at the University of Cambridge, and engineering an HPC pipeline for neutral hydrogen source extraction at the University of Oxford.

Beyond my academic pursuits, I maintain a high-level professional career in music as an internationally recognised orchestrator, arranger, and music publisher. This dual career has equipped me with exceptional time management, discipline, and creativity, skills that I apply to all my endeavors.
